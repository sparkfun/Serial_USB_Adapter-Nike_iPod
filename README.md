[*SparkFun Serial to USB Adapter - Nike+iPod (DEV-08245)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8245)

This is a simple USB serial interface to mate with the Nike+iPod product. 
Use this breakout board to send and receive serial commands to the receiver and listen for individual foot pods. 
This will allow easy creation of proximity based projects and running/workout research. 
VCC (3.3V), ground, and iPod TX and RX are brought out to a standard header so that you can connect this board to a microcontroller.
